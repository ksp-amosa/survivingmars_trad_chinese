<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>

While wind speeds on Mars are generally mild, they can reach incredible speeds during dust storms. Still, the thin Martian atmosphere dictates that the average wind turbine would need winds around six times more powerful than those on Earth to create the same amount of thrust.
 
This technological challenge to take advantage of what little wind there is on Mars was solved by opting for vertical axis wind turbines, which are capable of catching the wind from all directions, instead of simply horizontal.  The materials used are light enough to self-start on much weaker forces than those most commonly used on Earth.","風力渦輪機從火星風中產生電力。產生的量取決於它們暴露的風力有多大，所以適當的定位是必不可少的，因為更高的地面往往有更多的風。

雖然火星上的風速一般較低，但在沙塵暴期間可以達到令人難以置信的速度。儘管如此，薄薄的火星大氣表明，平均風力渦輪機需要比地球上風力渦輪機強六倍的風力來產生相同數量的推力。
 
通過能夠從各個方向捕捉風的垂直軸風力渦輪機，而不是簡單地水平，解決了利用火星上的小風的技術挑戰。所使用的材料足夠輕足以在比地球上弱得多的力量下自行起步。

5373,"The Martian Colony is made up of a variety of buildings which provide power, life-support, comfort, protection from the weather, information, resources and a lot more - all things without which humans cannot exist on the red planet.

Buildings are built by using Martian resources while some can be brought from Earth as prefab buildings. All buildings, however, require a resource upkeep for maintenance. 

A construction site must be within the <em>Service Area</em> of <em>Drones</em> (relative to their control hubs) in order to receive the resources needed and then erected.

Some buildings require Power to operate, other are staffed by Colonists living nearby.

The <em>Performance</em> of any building indicates how effectively the building is performing its primary function. It depends on many factors such as researched technologies, upgrades and the current individual performance of the specific colonists working in the building. Qualified specialists and workers with high Morale will increase the performance of a building, while empty work slots, Renegades and workers with low Morale or other issues will be detrimental.

Buildings can be set to operate in three <em>Work Shifts</em> - first, second and night. Turning off some Work Shifts will conserve power and workforce. ","火星殖民地由各種各樣的建築物組成，它們提供電力、維生、舒適、免受天氣威脅、訊息、資源和其他等等人類若沒有即無法生存的事物。

建築物利用火星資源建造的，有些也可以以預製建築型式從地球出口。但是，所有建築物都需要維護資源。

建築工地必須位於<em>無人機</em> 的 <em>服務區</em> 內（與其控制中心相關），以便接收所需的資源並隨後建立起來。

一些建築物僅需要電力來運作，其它則是需要居住於附近的殖民者進行操作。

任何建築物的<em>性能</em>都表現建築物的主要功能如何有效。這取決於許多因素，例如研究科技、升級和當前在建築物中工作的特定殖民者的個人表現。具有高士氣的合格專家和工人將提高建築物的性能，而空崗位、叛徒和士氣低落或其他問題的工人將會對效能有害。

5376,"Mars is infamous for its large and sometimes quite lengthy Dust Storms which raise so much dust that they can be seen with telescopes from Earth. While the wind speeds reached during these storms are not quite dangerous, taking into consideration that Mars’s atmosphere is but 1% of Earth’s, the sheer amount of dust raised can knock field machinery out of order until fixed.

Another issue is that Mars’s fine dust particles are extremely dry and slightly electrostatic, which can cause damage to our electrical grid if a dust storm with more electrostatic properties appears.

MOXIEs and Moisture Vaporators do not function during dust storms.

Dust Storms suspend air traffic - all shuttles will finish their final courses and then return to their hubs until the storm passes.

Electrostatic Dust Storms are a rare occurrence. Lightning strikes during such storms can shutdown buildings for a time or drain the batteries of our drones and rovers. 

The greater the risk the Dust Storm is flagged to pose in an area, the higher the chance is for an Electrostatic Dust Storm to appear. Dust storms can also be a seasonal event, happening routinely in the most high risk areas.",
4146,Meteors,隕石
5377,"Meteors are extremely common in the solar system. Every day, small to medium sized meteors hit the Earth but most burn out quickly in the atmosphere without ever reaching the surface. Mars, on the other hand, has a very thin atmosphere and most meteors reach the surface. This is, sadly, a constant threat, and must be taken into consideration when designing our colonies. Domes can mostly withstand direct hits with manageable damage, but all buildings outside the protection of Domes are vulnerable. 

Redundancy in vital lifelines such as Water and Oxygen support is one way of risk management.",
5378,"Martian surface temperatures are freezing at best while being extremely cold most of the time. Although humans can’t withstand the Martian cold outside <em>Domes</em> (not without protective gear), most of our machinery is designed to function effortlessly in the cold. 
This, however, is subject to change when a weather event known as a Cold Wave appears. The low-density Martian atmosphere allows for rapid and dramatic temperature drops – drops so low, that all field buildings have to spend increased amounts of electrical Power to keep from succumbing to the cold. 

Cold Waves appear with a short warning period and also may be e seasonal event in areas of Mars flagged as being especially cold.

During a Cold Wave all <em>Water Tanks</em> freeze solid - rendering the colony somewhat vulnerable to water shortages if more unfortunate events overlap.

Out-dome buildings left without power also run the risk of freezing until the cold wave subsides or the area is heated via a Subsurface Heater. Buildings that have an inactive shift are very likely to freeze during that shift.",

<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>

On Mars, water is a rare and difficult to obtain commodity. As such, turning the Martian regolith into traditional, water based concrete was deemed unpractical very early on during the planning stages. Luckily, Mars is rich in another element with which a different type of concrete can be made – sulfur.

Sulfur-based, waterless concrete is literally the foundation for every aspiring Martian city. Concrete Extractors placed on spots rich in sulfur in the Martian soil, dig up the sulfur-rich regolith and store it as ready to use mix. It is later transported and heated by our <em>Drones</em> on construction sites, turning it into strong and enduring concrete.",

Electrical power on Mars comes mostly from renewable and cheap sources such as wind power (<em>Wind Turbine</em>) and sunlight (<em>Solar Panel</em>), but also from fission (<em>Sterling Generator</em>) and fusion based sources (<em>Fusion Reactor</em>) as the technology available advances.

<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>

Making the Martian soil fit for farming, even within the protection of Domes, takes heavy alterations. First, toxin removers are applied to rid the Martian regolith of toxic substances like perchlorates. Then, the use of chemical decompressors to break down common Martian compounds and make nutrients out of them is employed.

Some of the most important and widely used materials on Earth are made from polymers. While the dependency on such materials on Mars is artificially circumvented as much as possible due to the scarcity of the molecule (unlike Earth, Mars has no fossil fuel reserves to act as a polymer source), their importance cannot be avoided all together.

5406,The core mechanics of <em>Surviving Mars</em> explained.,
5407,Dust and Maintenance,
5408,"All buildings deteriorate over time. When a building's maintenance bar is filled a drone is dispatched to bring the required maintenance resource and service the building. If the resource is not supplied within a Sol the building will stop operating until the maintenance resource is delivered and the building serviced.

Martian dust and disasters contribute to the deterioration of buildings outside of Domes.

Extractors, Martian dust geysers, rocket landings and launches spread dust in the area around them causing increased maintenance to nearby buildings.

<em>Drones</em> are also susceptible to dust which may result in a breakdown. <em>Recharge Stations</em> clean drones during the charging process.",
5409,Resources and Construction,資源與建築
5410,"Construction of <em>Buildings</em> is the main use of resources on Mars. If a new construction site is placed within the <em>Service Range</em> of a <em>Drone</em> control point (<em>Drone Hub, RC Rover, or Rocket</em>), the Drones assigned to that hub will begin stockpiling the resources needed for construction.

IMPORTANT: Said resources also need to be within the Drone’s Service Range, either in <em>Storages</em> or in raw, <em>surface deposit</em> form.

Resources are either gathered from deposits or are produced in <em>Extractors</em>, <em>Factories</em> or <em>Farms</em>.

Deposits may be surface (<em>Metal</em> and <em>Polymers</em>), underground (<em>Metal </em>, <em>Rare Metals</em>, and <em>Water</em>) or terrain (<em>Concrete</em>).

Surface deposits are mined directly by Drones, while underground and terrain deposits require <em>Extractors</em> to be built above them. Resources are stockpiled in Extractors until Drones come to take the extracted resources away where they’re needed or move them to a Depot. 

Extractors also generate <em>Waste Rock</em> and have limited space to store it. If said facilities are full, the Extractor will stop working until Drones move the Waste Rock to a <em>Waste Rock Dump</em>.

Late game deep scanning can reveal deep underground Metals, Rare Metals and Water deposits which require specific techs before they can be extracted.",
3984,Anomalies,觀察點
8116,"Anomalies appear all over the map in scanned sectors. Sending a RC Explorer to analyze them will trigger their effects. An anomaly can be one of the following sorts:

<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>

Event Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Event.tga> – These anomalies trigger events, which can be associated with Mysteries or not. 

Research Anomaly<image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Research.tga>  – These anomalies instantly generate Research Points, which then contribute to any ongoing research.

Breakthrough Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Breakthrough.tga>  – These anomalies reveal a tech on the Breakthrough tree in the Research Screen.

Tech Anomaly <image UI/Icons/Anomaly_Tech.tga>  – These anomalies enable specific techs to be researched, no matter their place on the tech tree. 
",
5411,Power Distribution,電力延伸
5412,"Power is distributed along power cables from <em>Power Production</em> buildings (or <em>Power Accumulators</em>) to all buildings connected to the same grid. 

<em>Power Switches</em> can be constructed along cables, allowing us to connect or disconnect entire sectors of the grid at will. 

Power cables can sustain <em>Cable Faults</em> (either from <em>Meteors</em> or just because of general erosion) and will need repair every now and then by <em>Drones</em> – provided there are Drones within reach.

Cable Faults drain power from the grid. Repairing them requires Metals and may take some time

IMPORTANT: Denser power grids develop more Cable Faults.",
5413,"Colonists need Life Support resources in order to survive in the short term. These are <em>Water</em>, <em>Oxygen</em> and <em>Food</em>. Without access to any of these, a <em>Dome</em> will die out, with a shortage of Oxygen being the deadliest.

Both Oxygen and Water are supplied to Domes via a <em>Pipe Network</em> which must be connected to Oxygen and Water production buildings to ensure the possibility of using Water and Oxygen <em>Tanks</em> to manage temporary shortages.

Pipes are built by <em>Drones</em> and deteriorate over time, resulting in <em>Pipe Leaks</em> which drain Water and Oxygen from the system. Drones repair Pipe Leaks at the cost of Metals.

If a Dome is left without power it won't provide heating to Colonists and they may die due to exposure to the intense cold of the Red Planet.

Food, which can initially be brought from Earth via <em>Rockets</em>, can be grown later on using <em>Farms, Hydroponic Farms</em>, and <em>Fungal Farms</em>. In contrast to Water and Oxygen, Food is not a grid resource and needs to be transported with Drones.",
311,Research,研究發展
5414,"New technologies will unlock new <em> buildings, upgrades,</em> colonist <em>perks</em> and other benefits for the colony. Standard technologies are divided in five fields with different themes. Researching any technology will make a new technology within its field available for research. Some technologies have fixed positions in their fields, others have randomized positions.
Individual technologies are researched by generating research points equal to their costs. The <em>mission sponsor</em> may provide a fixed amount of research point per Sol, but research buildings will be needed to discover the later, more advanced, technologies in a timely manner. Outsourcing research is another option granting a fixed amount of research for a certain period in exchange for <em>Funding</em>.

Analyzing <em>anomalies</em> with an <em>Explorer</em> vehicle may grant research points or make new technologies available for research.

<center><image UI/Common/rollover_line.tga 2000> <left>

<em>Breakthroughs</em> are extraordinary technologies with powerful effects that are discovered only by special means. One way to unlock a breakthrough technology is to discover it in an anomaly on the surface of Mars. Different breakthrough technologies may appear in each playthrough.",
5415,Founders,創始者
5416,"The Founders are the first human pioneers of the red frontier and the first residents of the fledgling Colony. Their initial task is to prove the potential of the Colony and the viability of a permanent settlement on Mars.

After the Founders arrive on the planet, the Colony will be under evaluation for a certain number of <em>Sols</em>. No new Colonists will be available until the Colony is evaluated positively. A positive evaluation will be awarded if any Founders survive a certain number of Sols, or if the first child is born on the Red Planet.

Since the Founders number is limited to the capacity of the rocket, you may wish to handpick them using the <em>Review</em> command on the passenger rocket screen. Take care to micromanage their priorities during their first days on the Red Planet, using building priority and work slot management to guarantee that the crucial buildings are staffed.",
5417,"Every Colonist is a unique individual defined by his or her name, age category, workplace specialization, traits, and stats.

Colonists will automatically staff Residences within their Dome. Take care to provide enough living space for all of them.

Children and senior Colonists cannot work, but still require sustenance and residential space. The rest of the Colonists will seek jobs in and around their <em>Domes</em>, according to the building priority and their individual work specialization. <em>Buildings</em> with higher priority will be staffed first.

Specialized colonists will prefer to work in buildings corresponding to their individual specializations and will have better performance at such workplaces.

<em>Traits</em> define details about the individual Colonists. Traits that provide beneficial effects are called <em>Perks</em>, traits with negative effects are called <em>Flaws</em>. <em>Quirks</em> are neither positive nor negative. <em>Rare</em> traits define truly exceptional individuals.

Every Colonist has four stats defining his or her current condition. <em>Health</em> represents physical fitness. <em>Sanity</em> represents mental wellbeing. <em>Comfort</em> represents the quality of the Colonist’s life on Mars. <em>Morale</em> represents happiness, optimism and loyalty. For details about individual stats and a more comprehensive description of their effects, refer to the Colonist’s <em>Infopanel</em>.

Be careful - if all Colonists die, the Mars colonization mission will be terminated.",
5418,Colonists - Moving Between Domes,
5419,"Colonists may migrate to new Domes within walking distance of their current position, or farther away when Shuttle transport becomes available.

Homeless Colonists will travel to another accessible Dome with available residential space.

Each <em>Dome</em> can be set up to filter Colonists by age, specialization and other traits. Colonists with ANY of the desired traits and NONE of the undesired ones will remain in the Dome, while others will seek another Dome with available living space and filter that matches their traits.",
8117,Colonists - Managing Specializations and Traits,
8118,"Colonists with no specialization may be educated to receive a specialization in the Martian University. The University can provide needed specializations automatically or focus on a single desired specialization.

Some, but not all, undesirable Flaws may be cured in the Sanatorium spire. Up to three different flaws can be treated in a single Sanatorium.

The School building cultivates desired Perks in children living in the Colony. They have a chance to receive any of the three selected Perks when they grow up. Not all Perks can be trained in School. The Playground building cultivates random Perks in children who visited it.

The University, Sanatorium and School buildings are treated as workplaces - colonists being educated or treated there cannot work a job at the same time. The individual performance of the colonists determines how fast they receive a specialization, cure a flaw or their chance to cultivate a Perk from School. The Playground service building grants its effect to any children who visit it at least once during their childhood.",
5420,Rover and Drone Control,
5421,"All Rovers are manually controlled via the commands available in their <em>Infopanels</em>. They can either be given orders to go to a map location or to interact with a contextually specific map object – such as <em>Anomalies</em> or <em>Surface Deposits</em>.

<em>Drones</em> are semi-autonomous and will queue up tasks that are flagged only if these tasks are within the <em>Service Area</em> set for each drone. However, the player can take direct control of a Drone if needed.
<cut_if_not_platform('desktop')>
Change your preferred controls and mappings using the Options menu.",
5423,"The map is divided in <em>Sectors</em> which need to be scanned to reveal what resources and Anomalies they hold – if any. 

Sectors can be queued for scanning from the <em>Map Overview</em>. Sensor towers drastically increase the scanning speed of sectors near them and provide a smaller overall bonus to sector scanning.

A fast and expensive way to explore the map is to buy <em>Orbital Probes</em> from Earth which instantly scans a chosen sector. 

Building in unexplored Sectors carries the risk of building directly on top of undiscovered <em>resource deposits</em>.","地圖被區分為<em>地圖區塊</em> 需要被掃描才會顯現該區的物資跟觀

7073,There's more to the barren environs of the Red Planet than meets the eye - a veritable treasure trove of undiscovered knowledge and wonder… So long as you know where to look.,
5684,"Even the tiniest, simply-looking rock can contain the answers to mysteries which perplexed the human mind for generations. Sometimes it takes just a simple discovery to assure us of the vastness of the Universe, an encouragement to make us look beyond the boundaries of our existence and into the future.

<effect> The following Techs have been revealed on the Research screen:
<list_text>",
5685,Open Research Screen,
7788,A Mission In Jeopardy,
8124,The recent Colonist deaths are a worrisome trend which cannot be ignored!,
7789,"While the Applicants who came to Mars were aware of the many risks that would await them, the near-criminal neglect from our side is something different. We cannot keep this information from the public – and opinions are swaying in the direction that our Colony is a “death trap”.

This troublesome rumor deters many valuable candidates from coming to the new frontier – and these are people we desperately need to fulfill the great mission of colonizing Mars and bringing our vision of the future closer.

<hint> Each time a Colonist dies from a non-natural death, <ApplicantsLostOnColonistDeath> Applicants leave the pool.",
8125,Scientists and visionaries have promoted the idea of “Humanity as a multi-planetary species” as the only way to prevent a possible mass extinction.,
7736,"The dwindling resources on our planet, overpopulation and environmental crisis, as well as the risk of a global-scale Armageddon create a powerful argument for anyone doubting the importance of our mission.

It is a well understood fact that it’s a matter of “when” not “if” for a major extinction event to happen. Having a self-sustaining population on a world other than Earth when the time comes should drastically increase humankind’s odds of survival.

<goal><objective>",
8126,"We have to admit that we failed to accomplish one of the main goals set before our mission. Sadly, we underestimated the difficulties of sustaining a large population on the Red Planet.",我們必須承認在火星任務執行之前設定的主要目標之一失敗了。非常不幸，我們低估了在這紅色星球上維持龐大人口的難度。
7738,"But this failure shouldn't throw us into despair. We still have to strive to create a stable, self-sustaining foothold from which humanity would reach the stars and conquer them.

<effect>Mission Evaluation objective failed - you have <count> Colonists out of <target> present on the planet. Final Score: <Score>.",
8127,As the Evaluation Day dawns upon us we can clearly say that the mission to Mars was a success.,
7739,"Even that we didn't surpass the expectations, the stable trends of development of the colony are encouraging.

Our achievement is still a tremendous success – we did something which no one imagined to be possible. The Colony would now be a symbol of hope and new beginning, a proof that humanity would persevere and live on regardless of the challenges we face.

<effect> Mission Evaluation objective completed - you have <count> Colonists out of <target> present on the planet. Final Score: <Score>.",
7735,Mission Evaluation: The Exodus,
8128,Congratulations! Everyone at Mission Control rejoices as the Colony has been marked as “extremely successful” in the Evaluation Report.,
7740,"We managed not only to achieve our goals, but also to surpass all expectations as the size of our current Colony is far beyond the initial estimations. This day will be marked in human history by the importance of our accomplishment – we secured the future of humankind as interplanetary species. The Colony would now be a symbol of hope and new beginning, a proof that humanity would persevere and live on regardless of the challenges we face.

<effect> Mission Evaluation objective completed - you have <count> Colonists out of <target> present on the planet. Final Score: <Score>.",
8129,"Our civilization, in all its glory, still bears the mark of obsolete cultural and ideological beliefs, from times when people didn't know any better. If we remain ignorant of our own flaws we risk destroying the future for our children.",
7742,"New horizons open new possibilities. Mars can be viewed as a blank canvas – a hostile, uncultivated place where humanity can start anew. A fresh start needs new people – people born on Mars, raised in a society where people cooperate and fight the odds instead of each other.

<goal><objective>",
8130,"The Mission Evaluation period is over and the progress we've made was marked as... sub-optimal, to say the least.",
7743,"Martian birthrate trends are still susceptible to malicious undercurrents and the Colony depends largely on the arrival of Applicants from Earth.

The Sponsors are disappointed that their program goal - a new human civilization on Mars - can't be achieved yet. Probably it was too early to expect that humanity can beat the odds of survival on such a hostile world and reach the level of everyday comfort required to start thinking about children and the future. The burden to disprove the evil tongues who would say this is impossible now lies on our shoulders. There's still work to be done

7174,Our Explorer just got into a pretty serious accident. The good news is it’s still in one piece.,我們的探索者號遇到了些嚴重事故，好消息是它還完好無缺。
5818,"The vehicle stumbled upon a crust fault which could have lasted for a couple hundreds of years under the slow erosion of the planet. Disturbed by the mechanical motion of the scanning probes, the surface opened like a wound and swallowed the rover, luckily, only for a dozen of meters. The sturdy machine got out of the hole, but nevertheless it sustained heavy damage.

Millions of years ago Mars had been shaken to its core by cataclysmic impact which sealed the fate of the planet. Since then Mars, like all giants, is dying, too slow for our mortal eyes to witness. Yet even today the death-throes of the Red Planet can be felt unmistakably.

<effect>The RC Explorer has malfunctioned. It has to be repaired by Drones.","它偶然發現了一個地殼斷層，在星球緩慢的侵蝕下可能已存在數百年。受到掃描探鑽頭運作的影響，其表面像傷口一般打開並吞噬了探測車。幸運的是， 堅固的機器自行從洞中脫困，但仍然受到嚴重破壞。

數百萬年前，火星因為地核受到災難性影響而注定了它的命運。從那以後，火星如同其他巨星一樣逐步走向死亡，不過我們短暫的生命無法見證它的死亡。然而即使在今天，紅色星球的死前掙扎也可以毫無疑問地感受到。

Those unacquainted would be astonished when they see the mission reports where dozens of minor breakdowns happened during an expedition and were ignored by the operators. Expedition veterans know that a dead light bulb won't break down the vehicle and they ignore it with a wry smile.

5879,"Without any credible explanation, the Colony was soon flooded with various rumors and interpretations of the mystery. What if they're bombs? Billions of tiny bombs? Or transport capsules maybe, with a mini robot inside. Or deadly hard drives. Or alien eggs? Or messages needing decoding. Or they're all parts of a bigger whole. Jigsaw puzzles that need to be put together.

The team at Mission Control is against trying to spread further misinformation and propaganda – partially because it would just add to the total confusion, but mainly because it would endanger the philosophical principles of our mission. We could only trust in our Colonists and hope for the best.",
5880,We have to come up with something better.,
5881,Power of Three: Dark Properties,
7190,On-site analysis of the unidentified structure only deepens the mystery. The evidence suggests that the cubes are clearly not a natural phenomenon.,
5882,"The insides of the cubes as well as the physical forces behind their levitation remain an enigma. Individual cubes as well as their combined structure retain a perfect symmetry and any attempts to physically disturb their positions have failed.

What is even more puzzling is the analysis of the photonic spectroscopy of the cubes. They seem to emanate radiation of an unknown wavelength which excites the separation of electrons inside of the spectroscopic lens. While our science team refuses to jump to any conclusions, the Chief Engineer suggests that we should study the effect empirically on the Colony’s Solar Panels.

The science team requested permission to commence experimental research on the cubes' properties.

<effect>New research on the mystery of the Black Cubes is now available",
5883,We should rearrange our research priorities.,
7191,Primary analysis of the Black Cubes revealed no conclusive answers. The cubes may somehow affect our Solar Panels. New Breakthrough research is now available.,
5885,Power of Three: Post–benign,
7192,Recent orbital scans revealed a sudden surge of energy on site. It’s now evident that the cubes pose a far greater threat than blocking our infrastructure plans.,
5886,"It appears the Black Cubes materialized inside the Extractor. We could only guess what happened to the building.

It seems any of the artifacts could materialize inside a structure, sending it into oblivion. We are now facing the potential threat of future human casualties.

Mission Control advises a top priority on the investigation of the disaster.

<effect>More buildings could collapse in the future. Preventive research is now available.",
5887,A potential solution! This is great news.,
5888,We confirmed that the Extractor was destroyed by the Black Cubes. New preventive research is now available.,
5889,Power of Three: A Time For Speculation,
7193,The latest research confirms that the cubes seem to be interfacing with each other. Almost like they’re forming some kind of device.,
5890,"The science team is divided in two camps: those who speculate it will amplify the cube signals allowing them to transmit through the reaches of space, and those who believe it could be some kind of weapon meant for destruction, not communication.

Outside the labs however, the cult of the Cubes has gained even more momentum. People are gathering to wait for what they think would be the coming of God to humanity’s second home.",
5891,"A culmination seems to be imminent, that’s for certain.",
5892,Power of Three: Solace in Science,
7194,We’ve applied the scientific method in every possible way to no avail. Time to try something else.,
5893,"In a moment of brilliance, or possibly desperation, one of the physicists proposed they should try to crack open the structures.

The scientists moved the cube matrix inside a non-baryonic shell and proceeded to bombard a single cube with high-energy ions, a process known as sputtering. The results were immediate – the shell of the cube gave in, resulting in its rapid decomposition. The matrix itself reacted to the influence by rearranging itself into a solid structure made of the remaining cubes.

Though we have no explanation for the process, at least we have a way to deal with the cube matrices popping up everywhere. It appears that the exact solution rests on our reason and moderation.

<effect>Cubes can be stored in special sites or destroyed",
5894,"Piece by piece, we will unravel this enigma.",
5895,Dark Spectrometry research completed. We can now store and destroy the cubes.,
5896,Power of Three: Embracing the Unknown,
7195,The mystery of the black cubes has consumed our Colonists completely. The reactions are as numerous as they are varied.,
5897,"The Colonists have divided into factions centered around a certain hypothesis about the nature and purpose of the mysterious artifacts.

The excitement about the cubes is evident from the schedules of the weekly hearings in the Colony. The trivial themes such as the quality of the food and the requests for additional scientific funding had completely disappeared, replaced by requests for publicity for each faction’s viewpoint.

So far, there are three major camps. The moderate skeptics argue that the truth is hardly within our reach and cubes need to be preserved and stored for further research. The pessimistic ones insist on the destruction of all the cubes, seeing them as a deliberate threat. Then, there are those who hold the firm belief that the cubes are meant to be a gift to humanity from some unknown benevolent entity. They request the cubes to be transported inside the Domes and put on display for everyone to see.

<effect>Decoration Buildings made out of cubes can be constructed.",
5898,"A gift or a Trojan horse, I wonder...",
5899,Decorations can be created from the Black Cubes.,
5900,Power of Three: Primal Fear,
7196,We are attempting to make some sort of sense of the laws that govern the cubes’ behavior. But it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In a pitch-black cave. While blindfolded.,
5901,"Still, our scientists managed to define to some extent why the cubes sometimes materialize inside our buildings. It seems that some cryptic algorithm first sends a pulse of tachyons to the area where the cube will materialize. If the Cherenkov radiation measurements are within certain limits, the cube appears on the spot. Thus, the cubes avoid appearing inside rocks – indeed, none of our scans confirmed that any cube spawned inside of a high-density object.

Our structures tend to be much less dense than the monolithic Martian rocks. We can modify our sensor towers to create a fake Cherenkov Effect by bombarding the areas around our structures with particles which are harmless to our Colonists, but would still prevent the cubes from threatening our Colony.

<effect>Sensor Towers now protect nearby buildings from the Black Cubes",
5902,A small victory – our efforts continue.,
5903,S.H.E.P.I.D. research completed. Buildings within range of our Sensor Towers will be protected from the cubes,

5904,"All cubes on Mars have started to pulsate, counting towards an unknown event.",
5905,Power of Three: The Countdown,
7988,"Within the hour all the cubes across the Colony started emitting light pulses, sending a wave of panic across the Colony. Even here at Mission Control we found it hard not to worry.",
5906,"The photovoltaic effect we observed earlier has completely disappeared. To make things worse, numerous glitches in the drone command software have our technicians scattering to extinguish fires all across the board. It seems that the pulses from the cubes are somehow interfering with the Drone uplink.

As reports are flowing in, we can clearly see a trend in the intensification of the light pulses. Is this some kind of countdown? And if so, to what?",
5907,"Just colonizing a new world isn’t interesting enough, it seems.",
5908,Power of Three: Of Mice & Men,
7989,Our Colonists want decisive action in dealing with the cubes.,
5909,"Some of them call for the immediate destruction of all the cubes while others still insist on storing and studying them – as far away from the Domes as possible. And yet, the number of eccentrics worshiping the cubes and erecting monuments with them has grown even larger. Could the cubes be affecting us like they influenced our drones?",
5910,We must not lose focus.,
5911,Power of Three: Construction Begins,
7990,Looks like we're fighting the cubes for the control of our drones. And we are losing that battle.,
5912,"Between their usual command cycles, the drones have begun carrying cubes to a specific location and seem to be constructing a strange structure.

Diagnostics on the drone software and hardware reveal no clues for any reprogramming. All of our attempts to gather information about the purpose of this operation have failed.

Mission Control advises all personnel to brace for the unknown.

<effect>Some Drones are constructing a mystery building with the cubes.",
5913,At least our Drones aren't attacking us yet.,
5914,Affected Drones are building something of alien design.,
5915,Unknown Construction,
5916,Drones influenced by the cubes have started the construction of a Mega Monolith,
7991,"Once completed, the monument emitted a pulse of all-encompassing energy and we all experienced a single collective dream! Or memory? ",
5918,"Eons ago, while Earth was still a molten world, Mars had already been a teeming, living world covered by oceans and forests. This long-forgotten Mars was the home for a sentient race which quickly mastered their primitive urges and reached technological peaks yet to be conquered by humankind.

We witnessed the astonishing evolution of the Ancients and the countless metamorphoses they experienced until they reached a state of existence which allowed them to transcend the boundaries of the material form. Without worrying about resources or lifespan, they traversed the universe, leaving their home behind. But they have not forgotten it.

The robust Black Cubes lay in wait on the Red Planet for a meeting of the minds. Our actions here were detected by the semi-sentient algorithm which controlled the cubes and triggered the message left by the Ancients. Some of the accounts given by our personnel describe being talked to in a language both familiar and thoroughly alien, while others describe being shown images most vivid and influencing. Some would even account for experiencing a sort of judgment. The essence of the information was, however, without exception, the same.",
5919,"I saw it, too...",
7992,"The Ancients were pleased to see we had reacted with restraint and curiosity, trying to understand the unknown phenomenon instead of fearing it. ",
5920,"Judging from their own history, they assume this was not necessarily an easy thing to do.

5922,We communed with the Ancients in our collective dream. They were impressed by our curiosity.,
7993,The Ancients were set back by the hostile reaction we had towards their messengers – the cubes.,
5923,"Ultimately they expressed understanding, noting that there were times in their own long history, dark times when they had the same hostile response towards the unknown.

They hope that with time and maturity we will come to embrace the idea that while the universe is a dangerous place, not everything is a threat and there are also wonders to be discovered.

5924,We communed with the Ancients in our collective dream. They were somewhat surprised by our hostility against the unknown.,
7994,The Ancients were intrigued and quite surprised by our choice to indulge in creations of art with their cubes.,
5925,"Oblivious to the concept of higher powers, they seemed to see no other reason for our actions other than a pursuit of aesthetic decoration, one that seems to have eluded them as a possibility.

Not quite sure what to make of this, they express hope we will retain our creativity as a race in the ages ahead.

<effect>The monument collapsed into a pile of Black Cubes

5927,"Meanwhile, reports from all over the Colony indicate that all cubes have ceased their pulsating and reverted to their previous lifeless state. Many Colonists report to the medical facilities that they feel different states of depression – ranging from melancholy to outright despair. Could these events be attributed to the mysterious structure and the death of the cubes? We would never find out.

<effect>All Colonists suffer penalties to Morale.",

With the current state of events we lack sufficient data to judge the purpose of the cubes. It could take years if not generations of scientific research to reach a conclusion on that subject. Until then, we will attempt to control the erratic spread of the cubes which hampers our resources and colonization operations by storing them away in a convenient manner.",
5932,Only time will tell if we are right.,
5933,Power of Three: Might Makes Right,
7997,The primary goal of our mission is the permanent colonization of Mars. Any potential threat to humanity’s pioneers is to be eliminated.,
5934,"We will attempt to remove all the cubes from our immediate area. A decision as serious as this required a consensus, which was reached through a vote at Mission Control. The public may deem this decision wrong, but we cannot place the fate of the entire Colony on our desire to wait it out. History had taught us that the inability to act often results in disaster. The destruction of cubes will proceed as planned.",

Via its telescopic arm a camera and sonar were inserted within the Object, revealing a perplexing maze of cavities and corridors inside. A close inspection below the Object shows that it digs a hole beneath itself through a rotation of its frontal hull and extracts metal-rich ores, but its position above the ground level remains the same.

With the help of the its telescopic arms and on-board spectroscopic equipment, the RC Explorer helped us find out that the hole was dug up on top of a subsurface resource deposit. The amount of discarded waste rock as well as the volume of the hole suggested that the Object sifted through the soil and took away only the usable bits. What the purpose of this was is unknown.

The Dredger did nothing, so the RC Explorer ventured closer to it, taking more samples of its hull and probing its insides with various scanning equipment.

It is now evident that the outer shell of the Dredger consists of silicates and heavy inert metals with no traces of organic materials. The inner walls of the jet vents contain traces of burned alkaline metals. Some of our scientists propose that they are the fuel used to propel the Dredger during flight and take-off.

Without bothering you with the tiresome technical details, the extraction and utilization of Martian resources is crucial to the success of Mars Alpha and our ability to settle in the Solar System.

Our Colony's safety and viability is our utmost priority. This is why I’ve personally supervised operations to deny the alien vessels the opportunity to extract and steal away the metal deposits crucial to our survival.

The actions I ordered were not an act of war and aggression, but instead were means to secure the future of our initiative and fulfill a promise to all people on Earth. Dismantling several alien vessels is a fair price to pay for what's at stake today.

Here comes the best part – the Dredgers are quite vulnerable! The alkaloid fuels they utilize for propulsion makes them highly volatile in oxygen-rich atmospheres. This is probably the reason why no Dredger landed on Earth so far.

6083,Inner Light: The Advent,
6084,"It is so unexpectedly pleasant that any fears of food or drug poisoning are quickly doused and forgotten. And then you hear the voices – people laughing, yelling, crying... speaking. The language is incomprehensible but you sense the presence of friendly and strangely familiar entities. The shimmering lights start forming patterns and sparks flash briefly, revealing scenes from another place.

You struggle to concentrate and maintain control and the mirage dissolves. You're left alone and confused in the command room.",
7201,"Sitting at your desk, a strange light appears in the corner of your vision. It pulsates and intensifies, bathing the room in a warm glow. It feels... Actually, it feels just about right.",
6085,What just happened...?,
6086,You have witnessed bizarre hallucinations with no logical explanation.,
6087,Inner Light: Wake Up Call,
6088,"“Multiple signals from the Colony are coming in and everyone at Mission Control is worried. People are falling asleep on the streets and at their work stations, some report vivid hallucinations. The affected Colonists express symptoms of high stress and have been put under medical supervision. We’ve also exchanged information with Earth Control but they report no activity on their end. It seems the event is localized on Mars.”",
7202,And you’re not the only one who’s seen this odd mirage.,
6089,This mystery is only getting deeper.,
6090,The mirages have affected others as well. Colonists experience visual hallucinations and some have entered a trance-like state.,
6092,"When you open your eyes, you find yourself hundreds of meters above the ground. The panic overtakes you and you wave your limbs frantically as you try to grasp something. Despite the fact that you aren't falling – a strong rope supports you near the trunk of a gigantic tree, taller than any skyscraper. You compose yourself just on time to hear your sister laughing way above you.

“What are you doing, Kal? Stop it, silly!” You hear her voice directly in your mind. The realization of where you are hits you with full force. You remember that your name is Kal. That you and your numerous Clan call this tree Home.

You take a deep breath and look at the horizon, the bright sun is almost completely covered by thick veil of red and orange.",
7203,It’s so much stronger this time - you manage to fight it for a minute a two before you sink into a hypnotic slumber.,
6091,Inner Light: Childhood's End,
6094,"“Kal, another dust storm is coming. Let's finish with these moss veins and get back inside.” You clench the rope with your six-digit, two-thumb hands and start climbing towards the last of the moss veins which keeps the bark of Home healthy and alive.

“This one is almost completely dry, too.” You speak out, which upsets your sister. You remember that speaking words instead of sending them had always been an expression of deep, uncontrollable feelings. “Only four dozen out of three hundred are still alive. I fear Home will not survive for much longer. Mother would be devastated.”

You both enter Home in grim silence. As you enter the dim-lit hollow, the mirage fades and you wake up in your chair.",
7204,"Lea. Her name comes back to you as she looks toward the horizon, frowning.",
6096,Inner Light: Fallen to Dream,
6097,"The staff has dubbed the more susceptible ones “Dreamers,” as it seems that witnessing the mirage sends them into a deep hypnotic slumber where they experience intense emotions and physical strain. Attempts to wake up a Dreamer had proven disastrous – the Colonist screamed, fell into shock and had to be sedated to prevent a potential heart attack.

As you read this, you wonder when you would become one of these unfortunate souls, unable to take care of the Colony.",
7205,"The shimmering lights sweep through the Colony, pulling Colonist after Colonist into ever deeper states of trance.",
6098,Only time knows.,
6099,The mirages have intensified. Some Colonists have fallen deeper into the hallucinations than others. We have dubbed these people Dreamers.,
6100,Inner Light: Psychometry,
6101,"It supports the hypothesis that they experience real events rather than hallucinations or an imagined reality. The scientific community on Earth discarded the paper as rubbish and some have even condemned the author.

The Chief Scientist, however, believes the hypothesis could lead somewhere and wants to run MRI scans as they monitor the Dreamers, especially while they are in the trance, and analyze the data.

<effect>New research on the mystery of the Dreamers is now available.",
7206,One of Earth’s top scientists has a new and intriguing paper on the Dreams. An unorthodox one.,
6102,Sweet opportunity!,
6103,We have devised a system to monitor the Dreamers. We should divert resources to Dream Simulation research to shed light on the mirages.,
6105,"You’re sitting in your spartan office, re-reading the letter you got from your Mother. Every letter of her handwriting bears the emotional imprint of grief and desperation and you fail to remain calm. She’s writing to ask for your help as a steward to Watcher Bor, a powerful representative of the Authority you've been serving almost a decade now. The dust storms and the drought have hit the Clan badly in the recent cycles, bringing the horrors of starvation upon them. The neighboring Clans have already given in to the merciless heat and fled to the cities, abandoning the empty dry husks of their Home Trees to rot in the sun.

You are afraid that you won't be of much help to your Clan. From what you’ve witnessed so far, you know well that the Authority is aware of the hardships the farming Clans are facing but denies the severity of the drought. Above all else, you fear the reaction of your master, yet your loyalty to your Mother leaves you with no other choice but to talk to him.",
7207,"You sit comfortably as the Mirage washes over you, taking you deeper into the trance. The next thing you know, you’re Kal once again.",
6106,"“Kal, I already know what’s bothering you. Or you presumed that such an obvious thought wouldn’t have surfaced? Of course not. Anyway, I strongly recommend you not to give way to such… lowly concerns. Kal, look at me. Do you truly believe the lies your Mother has fed into your heart? Do you believe that the Authority would allow their people to die in vain? These thoughts are forbidden and you know what the punishment is…”

You shiver when he mentions it. He smiles at your reaction.

“You have been such a good steward all these years, and I know that you would never betray my trust. This nonsense ends now. Do we have an agreement, Kal?”

You hear yourself whisper, “Yes, Watcher.”",
7208,"The Watcher senses your approach, turning to face you before you can so much as utter a word.",
6107,"The event is purely for show, as is the enthusiasm with which the public applauds the Watcher’s last words. Not that they have any other option – any misdemeanor is an instant trip to the reeducation stations.

You can see some people in the crowd who are Clan representatives from the neighboring farms. Almost the entire region is gathered here. You have to show them the truth – that the Authority doesn't care about them, that they are alone. Maybe then it would make a change!",
7209,Later that evening you stand next to the Watcher as he gives a speech before the Chamber of Labor.,
6108,You jump out in front and telepathically project the message.,
6109,You keep it to yourself and wait for a better time to act.,
6110,"You wake up abruptly, with the feeling that something is wrong. You don't remember it that way...",
7210,You have a moment in front of the crowd before reality crystallizes. Freezes. Shatters.,
6104,Inner Light: Fleeting Reality,
6111,"You keep your mouth shut and calm your thoughts, hoping that Bor is distracted enough by the conversations with the rich industrialists to not notice your momentary excitement. You know that your time will come soon – wasting the opportunity to help your Clan now wouldn't do any good.

You wake up in your room, back on Mars, with a feeling of purpose and relaxation.",
7211,“Patience is a virtue.” You can practically hear your Clan Mother saying it now.,
6095,Wake Up,
6112,Our scientists have proposed  that the intensity of the hallucinations is linked with the number of people who experience them.,
6114,"The sense of danger tingles in the back of your head, a keen tool you have developed over the years of climbing through the intrigue-filled political structure of the Authority. Your contacts wouldn’t be so enigmatic, but neither would be any assassins sent by your competitors to put an end to you. You admit to yourself that your curiosity is sparkled, but you take precautions and tuck in the small pistol in your robes before getting outside.

The night is very hot, even though it is winter. The weather these days had gone crazy and it has been both a blessing and a curse – it served your cause well, giving extra credibility to your mutinous words, but it also whispered the coming end for the last of the farming Clans and the cities overflowing with starving refugees. You sit by the orchards and prepare for a long wait.",
7212,"Kal. The note in your hand bears your name, its mysterious writer bidding you to visit them in the garden.",
6115,"“Lea...” Your breath stops in your throat, silencing your voice. You feel tears forming in the corners of your eyes. Your sister projects love and happiness over the telepathic link and sweeps her own tears away.

“Is it really you, Kal? I've missed you so much!”

“I'm so happy to see you! Where have you been? What happened to you?”

“I've been doing the same thing as you – trying to free us from the Authority. I've found out terrible secrets and the solution to our problems – but it's dangerous, even fatal. My comrades devised a cure.” She opens her palm – two vials of pale liquid lay there. “So I've come to you to take the cure with you. If I'm to die here today, I want to do so in your embrace, Kal. We are the only survivors of our Clan and I want to rest with my people.”

“What are you talking about, Lea? It doesn't make sense!”",
7213,Your eyes flutter open as you feel the presence of someone else there. A figure in the bushes. You can’t help but to gasp as they step into the dim glow of the streetlight.,
6116,"“We have been deceived the whole time, Kal. The Clans exist for only a generation; our centuries-long traditions and culture are a lie. The people from the cities killed the land with their industry and their wars, so the Authority crafted us from flesh and blood to resettle the planet and work like slaves to feed the cities. But the drought proved stronger than they thought, so they are abandoning us. We are a failed project, Kal, but we are also living people and we refuse to let go and die.”

She pauses to catch her breath.

“The Authority couldn't release millions of people without a safety kill-switch. So they imprinted our genes with stronger telepathic abilities – so that they could read our minds and wipe us out with terrible weapons designed to kill only us. To be free, we must severe our telepathic link. This is what the cure does, but it kills one in three. It is crucial to set you free, Kal, because you're a Watcher. You can deceive the Authority about the people in this sector and allow us to spread the cure through the local Clans. Then we will have an army.”

You are unsure and confused. But Lea presses on.

“No time to think, Kal. Let's do it now – let's take the cure together.”",
7214,"Lea sits down beside you, taking your hand.",
6117,"“We’ll take the cure together, Lea. I'm here with you, there's nothing to be afraid of.”",
6118,"“No, Lea, let me be the only one to take the risk. I can't lose you now that I've just found you.”",
6119,“I know people who will help us refine the cure and make it safer. No need to rush now.”,
6120,"Then oblivion comes. You fall unconscious, failing to witness the convulsions which shake your body. You wake up just before dawn. Lea lies still beside you. She's not breathing.

The rising sun mercilessly dries your bitter tears from the sand.

“Welcome back, silly.”

7216,The liquid in the vial tastes like nothing. Like death. You can barely hear yourself say it before a wave of oblivion sweeps over you.,
6113,Inner Light: Always Together,
6125,"Luckily, you know just the right disillusioned government biologists who would take great interest in the formula for the cure. You hide the vials under your robe and give Lea a hand. You sit down by a tree and talk for hours and hours until the sun dawns on the horizon. Then she kisses you farewell and vanishes in the waking city. You have the feeling that you will see her soon enough.

<effect>Additional Dreamers are created.",
7217,Finding your sister after all these years. The thought of losing her again is enough to break you.,

6128,"For a moment you think there is another Mirage happening, but it’s no such thing. You clearly remember the voices who kept on repeating the same words over and over:

“Find us again, Kal! Don’t you remember us? Find us again, Kal…”

You cannot shake the feeling that there were voices of people from the Colony and some others who sounded strangely familiar.

<hint>Let more Dreamers experience the Mirages.",
7218,"You wake up startled under your own bedsheets, the world outside pitch black. A disturbing dream, not that you remember much of it.",
6129,Strange. And disturbing…,
6131,"The doors behind you shut just as the shuttle takes off. No time to catch your breath as the gathering is about to begin.

Hundreds of people had come to the Red Valley Home Tree to answer your call. The conspiracy you’ve been gathering in the past year or so has grown to numbers which require the establishment of organization or at least a unified plan for the future. This is why you have ventured to the other side of the globe to contact local anti-Authority dissidents.

The things you have seen lifted the veil created by the misinformation and propaganda you had all been fed. You have seen cities overrun by disease and starvation, where angry mobs riot every day in a desperate attempt to avoid the inevitable. You have seen the barren landscapes of the planet, dotted by the ruins of cities and factories, where nothing lives and grows. The world is dying and you know this with all of your heart and mind.",
7219,The day is searing hot. You find refuge in the blessedly cool corridors of the Home Tree.,
6132,"They all await you to start the meeting and you don’t keep them in suspense. The horrible truth devours your heart and you have to share the burden with them, listen to their words and advice and set the course for the future.

You know the gathering wouldn’t be easy as the tensions had grown strong within the ranks of the resistance – Clansmen straying from city-dwellers and vice versa. Bad blood is running between the two groups, each viewing the other as something far too different to tolerate. You’re attributing much of this behavior to the recent effects of the Cure taken by your clansmen, which turned their world upside down. You hope they realize the vital role of the city dissidents – mostly scientists and thinkers – who bear skills and knowledge of which your people had been deprived on purpose.

You don’t have any intention to delay the meeting. You stand before the crowd and start to raise your voice. The murmur in the reservoir stops and everybody listens.",
7220,"The waters of the deep ground reservoir are long gone, replaced now with the leaders of various resistance cells.",
6133,"You describe the pictures of the dying world and make sure they understand that the clock is ticking for all of you. You cannot wait for better times, but the raw military might of the Authority makes any attempt for direct confrontation a lost cause. After all, your people are farmers, not soldiers. One by one, the cell leaders speak their minds. The discussion is heated and continues until late in the night. You dismiss the gathering with the promise to continue tomorrow.

Later you’re lying in bed and the sleep is chased away by your heavy thoughts. You realize that your word weighs a lot and, whichever solution you support, it would probably be the course for the future. Some of the Clansmen propose that all must hide deep in the desert and live off the land the way you did before – but this would mean condemning millions of people in the city to a starving death. The scientists who perfected the Cure uphold the plan to introduce gene-altering chemicals into the food rations sent to the city – this will instill the truth directly into the minds of the people and cause them to rise. You insist on taking the most brave and noble path – to send agents to spread the word to the people of the city. This would be dangerous and even fatal should the Authority agents get their hands on you.",
7221,"You talk for what seems an eternity, hoping beyond hope that your words are enough to reach the hearts of your audience.",

The next generations could judge you harshly for the morality of your actions, or they could praise you for your bravery. You don’t care.

You walk undisturbed among the chaos. The people view you as a prophet of the end times. No one dares raise their hand against you. When the crowd sees you it parts to let you through. Everyone is waiting for the Truth to flow from your mouth.

You haven’t asked for this. You only hope that when the Authority in Bedlam is toppled, the people listen to you once more and prepare to face more difficult times ahead. This is what fills your mind as you walk the dusty, debris-covered streets.",
7225,Bedlam burns with the fires of the revolution.,

All motion stops – the officer pointing with his gun at you, the crowd, even the wind. You reach out to him. “Give me the gun,” you say. Then you turn to the mob. “What would the death of one man do to help you? Go back to your homes and families!” There’s a second of hesitation. One by one, the street empties.

The officer breathes a sigh of relief. He throws the gun on the ground and looks you right in the eye for a minute. Then he gestures for you to follow him. For some reason, you know he’s not a threat. You don’t need telepathy to tell you it, either. “Kal, right? The ex-Watcher? Know you’re going to get a kick out of this. You’re the only one of those nut jobs knows how to use it. Come on.”

He leads you to a bunker. The guards are long gone, fled or taken by the crowd. The officer opens the blast door and motions towards the entrance. ‘The Authority installed this thing a while back. Doesn’t meant a thing to me anymore. I got my life. That’s all that counts.’",

The sun sets on Bedlam. The palace of the Autharch has been taken over and the rule of the Authority is no more. You hope that the new day will bring new hope for survival and rebuilding of your tired, devastated world. This would be a monumental effort, but failure is not an option. All it takes is a helping hand. But you can save that for tomorrow. For now, you need to rest.

He suggested converting it into a broadcaster with which you could reach every single person within a thousand miles. Thus all people on the planet would learn of your cause and how Bedlam was now free.

You accept, but only if you shared the honor with the ones who were by your side in all of this. You gather all of your most loyal supporters, the bearers of the highest of moral virtues. You wait in the bunker, ready to share your Truth with all.",

6291,"We of Mars, who have denounced any militarization, have chosen to move on from the ways of the past and shape our new home into a place where military conflict is a thing of myth and legend. In doing so, we place our trust that this idea will resonate with all people back on Earth, our home world, and bring humanity not only to another planet, but to another level of evolution. Yet this incident has shown us that we may not do so without help from Mother Earth, and this trial today has renewed our hope that our vision for the future is not entirely wishful thinking.

6292,Marsgate,
6293,"The lengths he has taken to circumvent our detection not only by EsoCorp, but that of Mission Control as well, shows us painstakingly that we have failed him and probably many others like him. In their eyes we were playing for the other team. It puts us all to shame. Many citizens are showing their discontent with our Colony now that our own actions have been exposed, and back on Earth this whole ordeal is blowing up to mind boggling proportions. It has been dubbed “Marsgate” and we are accused of being compliant in the breaking of international and interplanetary treaties by the UN. 

Popular pressure has prompted that a trial start as quickly as possible. You will be required to defend our actions via satellite link.

<effect>You can’t repair any more EsoCorp rovers.",
7284,The cat’s out of the bag. One of our bolder Colonists took it upon himself to do what we couldn’t – expose EsoCorp and their dirty dealings on Mars.,

7506,Marsgate has exploded. One of our citizens has exposed EsoCorp and our involvement in the affair.,
6286,Marsgate: Wrong Side of History,
6287,"Joining the legal proceedings against the entity known as EsoCorp by satellite link is the head of the Mars Colony Project as a representative of <reg_param1> and the main victim in “Marsgate” other than the total disregarding of international and interplanetary treaties. The treaties, which are in place to discourage the militarization of any human endeavors in space, are held to be of utter importance by all present parties, except the defendant, and thus the transgression is seen as most grievous. 

Because communication with Mars is not at its peak at this time and will take too long for a proper discussion, know that our sponsors have shared your overall stance on the whole affair. Still, as the final verdict draws near we have decided it best if you say in your own words the implications of EsoCorp’s secretive and illegal military testing operations on Mars. ",

7287,Marsgate: The Blame Game,
6296,"EsoCorp put the lives of people, who brave an unforgiving world in the name of humanity, in danger with nothing more than profit in mind. We at Mission Control, on the other hand, are tasked with protecting the mission and the lives of all people taking part in it, so we did what we saw fit in order to see our duties are met. With guns pointing at our life support equipment and the closest help 3 million miles away, we were left with little choice and we stand by our decision. Why EsoCorp was able to send these rovers all the way to Mars without being detected from Earth is beyond us and we, the people of Mars, feel let down by Earth today.

7288,A tough moment. We tried our best not to fan the flames.,
7289,Marsgate: What Can Change the Nature of Man?,
6297,"EsoCorp came to Mars with force, deployed in our vicinity, breaking every law and basically putting a gun to our heads. It was a classic story of the strong bullying the weak, or in this case, someone completely unprepared for such an event. In a way it was a stab in the back, as we idolized Earth as a source of safety while we had to wrestle with the unforgiving calamities of Mars. 

We did not like it, but we came to the realization that it was only a matter of time before this happened and that it was better to have a strong ally. We are pioneers on a new frontier, opening countless possibilities and space for humans to be, well, humans. If it was not EsoCorp today, it would have been someone else tomorrow, I assure you. And that someone else might have come at different circumstances and not offered us, albeit indirectly, a way to stay on their good side. At the end of day, we may have changed planets, but we are still humans, with all the blessings and curses this fact carries in itself.

The scientists experimented with multiple growth mediums and discovered that the most effective way to proliferate the medicine is by introducing it in mold cells growing on potatoes. This is great news because we can provide enough biomass for the modified mold to grow and if we do it quickly, we can still stand a chance to end the suffering on Earth.

They are unsure what happened with the disease, and so are we, but they claim that it appears gone. Earth is welcoming to humans once more!

The survivors have just began restarting abandoned factory complexes and power plants to fuel the industry needed to rebuild the civilization from the ruins. People move into the cities and repopulate the farming areas. The economy is starting to build up momentum – and they want us to become part of the exchange once more!

The survivors have their spirits high, but still the fear of the Wildfire lies in all of them – what if it comes back? This is the reason why they’ve requested us to send them as much of the Wildfire Cure as we can.

We have decades – maybe even centuries before us – to cope with the damages caused, with the fear and desperation which reverberate inside all of us.

The Wildfire crisis has shown us how fragile we are, how the ivory towers we’ve built could crumble in mere days. Maybe it’s the perfect moment to step back and reconsider the way we lived our lives. To rebuild our civilization, but build it better than before.

The Wildfire Cure remains our hot lead towards the way the disease worked. By studying it we will be able to delve in the mystery of its structure and origin, preparing for worse days ahead.

Up towards the stars - above our superficial segregations and competing with ourselves. Up towards a united humanity spread out on many worlds… possibly even stars.  

I am more than certain that the last several thousand years of our history are but the bumpy road towards a version of humanity where there is no hunger, no war, no needless suffering and where the future holds nothing but opportunity and wonder.  And I also believe we are quite close to the end of this turbulent road.

8366,"You see, in you I find kindred souls, souls who do not view my speech at the UN as the ramblings of a deluded old billionaire. I’m certain my vision resonates with all of you up there; after all - you are a part of it.

My Beyond Earth initiative is pushing several separate projects simultaneously - all aimed at bringing prosperity and peace to a human race spread across the Solar System.

One of the projects in question is currently in a ditch - the planning of a Moon base to mine Hydrogen 3, called Aldrin Base. I’m certain I don’t need to tell you what an abundance of the material would mean energy-wise. I’d kindly implore you, if your situation permits it of course, to contribute some research capacity and quite frankly know-how to the Beyond Earth initiative.

8371,"Currently we are falling behind schedule at our Rubicon Station front - a deep-space shipyard tasked with expanding our space-faring capabilities - and would kindly request you to contribute Metals towards bringing the construction back on track.

We ran the numbers and have come to the conclusion that using Mars for firing raw materials towards our separate projects could prove far more effective than doing this from Earth and will speed up the whole process of bringing the project to fruition.

People are suffering and dying on Earth - in war, from deceases, from malnutrition. All of this is not necessary and my vision will remedy all of it, once complete.

So I convey this message to you, whom I have come to see as my closest partners in this endeavor: Please redouble your efforts, for it would please a dying old man greatly to see the plan bearing fruit before his death.
